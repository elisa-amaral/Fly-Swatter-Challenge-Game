If the 'fly' element is clicked  before it is automatically removed (deleted from the screen) and there still is time remaining and there still are lives remaining, then the user continues to play. If the 'fly' element is not clicked  before its automatic removal, the life points are affected. If var 'remainingTime' < 0 here at this point, it was before the lives ran out, so the user won the game -> redirect to victory.html. The purpose of the game is that the user to stays "alive" until the timer runs out.
